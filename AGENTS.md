# 1. Commit Guidelines

- 1.1: Do not add any descriptions to commit messages. Do not add any AI co-authorship to commit messages.
- 1.2: This is a proof of concept. Commit only to `main`. Do not create feature branches yet.
- 1.3: Tasks require an associated commit before completion. The user may request skipping the commit requirement.
